A causal inference method for Mendelian Randomization based on local distributions.

See the manuscript "Leveraging local distributions in Mendelian Randomization: Uncertain Opinions are Invalid" (Ziya Xu and Sai Li) for more details.

The file "funQ2-IVW.R" includes the main functions for the proposed method.

The file "MR-local-simu1.R" is the code for the numerical experiments in the manuscript.
